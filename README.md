### x-front-flex is a scaffolding framework I developed in ActionScript/Flex as the final project for my bachelor's degree, around 2007â€“2009. It generates complete CRUD views not only for the primary entity but also for its associations, using a rich internet application (RIA) front-end for the web. The framework features a complete window management system (similar to Windows, but in the browser), dozens of UI components, and numerous utility objects for handling animations, effects, formatting, rendering, validation, and more. As the technology has become obsolete, I no longer have a live example available. Screenshots of the framework in action are shown below:
